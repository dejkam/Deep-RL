Reinforcement Learning is going to be the next boom after the successful outbreak of LLMs across the world. It's now time to learn Reward Engineering, same as we have learned
how to do Prompt Engineering. Hence, I tried to wrap up all concepts from Maxim Lapan's invaluable book on Deep Reinforcement Learning into a repository making it easy and
accessible for every one to learn more about RL, in particula Deep RL. I have tried to also add more insights whenever it is possible and required to make things more clear for 
a prspoectus reader and learner.
